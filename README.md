  ## Description
  For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
  
   ## User Story
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
  Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.
  
  ## Installation Instuctions
 First create and import components to Employees.js and import react to the app.js. Next, in the terminal create React for application, run npm install followed by npm start. Finally, install github pages(npm install gh-pages --save-dev) and deploy application(npm run deploy).
